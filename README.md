Product Reviews Sinatra App

DESCRIPTION:
The application could be used in a reader mode without logging in, although you wouldn't be able to add new products and reviews. Once logged it, you can add products, rate and review them, edit ratings and reviews and delete them. You cannot edit or delete products, this is designed deliberately so that other user's reviews wouldn't be deleted.

USAGE:
Run db:migrate and then run shotgun, then go to the address provided.
